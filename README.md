# Generics Exercises 

## Description
In this task, we will delve into one of the most powerful and flexible concepts in 
the Java language: Generics.

Generics allow us to write more reusable, safe, and clean code, avoiding manual type 
conversions and reducing runtime errors.

You will work with generic classes and methods, learn how to constrain generics using 
interfaces or superclasses, and put into practice the use of varargs and bounded types. 
All the exercises are designed to help you understand the power of this functionality 
in real-world scenarios.
  
## Exercise Statement
Level 1: In this level, you will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of generics. 
You will learn to create classes and methods that work with any data type, and observe 
how Java manages flexible yet safe typing. Through interfaces or superclasses, you will 
put into practice the use of varargs and bounded types. All exercises are designed to 
help you understand the power of this feature in real-world scenarios.

Level 2: This level focuses on refining the use of generics, learning to combine generic 
parameters with concrete types, and safely using varargs with generics.

Level 3: IIn this level, you will combine advanced generics with interfaces, bounded 
types, and polymorphism. You will simulate a real-world example with devices that can 
make calls and take photos.

## Features
- Combine generic objects with specific types, including constraints with interfaces 
or classes.
- Use generic varargs and explore their implications.
- Apply constraints (bounded types) to control which type of objects can be passed 
to a generic method.
- Strengthen the relationship between generics, interfaces, and polymorphism.e.
